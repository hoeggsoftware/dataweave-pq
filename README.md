[![Unit tests](https://github.com/hoeggsoftware/dw-ext-pq/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hoeggsoftware/dw-ext-pq/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This is an open source dataweave library to provide an efficient priority queue.

## Inspiration
This work is based on publications by Gerth St√∏lting Brodal, Chris Okasaki, and David J. King.  Special thanks to [@amitdev](https://github.com/amitdev) for his [Purely Functional Priority Queues](https://amitdev.github.io/posts/2014-03-06-priority-queue/) blog as well.
