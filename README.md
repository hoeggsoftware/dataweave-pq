# Functional Priority Queues and Related Data Structures

This is an open source dataweave library to provide some useful data structures for computation in dataweave, including an efficient priority queue.

## Inspiration
This work is based on some papers I found by Gerth St√∏lting Brodal, Chris Okasaki, and David J. King

* [Functional Binomial Queues](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs312/2005fa/hw/binomial-queues.pdf)
* [Optimal Purely Functional Priority Queues](https://www.brics.dk/RS/96/37/BRICS-RS-96-37.pdf)
